# **Machine Learning: Project Part 2 - Seal Call Discrimination**

---

## **Objective**
The aim of this project is to analyse a recorded dataset to investigate the feasibility of discriminating between different seal calls. The project is structured in steps to build a machine learning model that can potentially detect seal calls from audio recordings. While creating a fully functional detector is the ultimate goal, it may not be the final outcome of this project.

**Part A - (`A. data_preprocessing.ipynb`)**: Data pre-processing, including extraction and cleaning of spectrograms, and generation of “no-call” data.

**Part B - (`B. model_selection.ipynb`)**: Model selection.

**Part C - (`C. model_refine.ipynb`)**: Refinement and optimisation of the chosen model.

## Environment & Dependencies

To run this project, you will need the following:
- **Python 3.8+** (or a compatible version)
